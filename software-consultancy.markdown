    <p>We are passionate about delivering high quality software to meet our customer's needs. Whilst we are pragmatic and understand there are trade-offs
    that sometimes need to be made to deliver projects on time and within budget, we refuse to compromise when it comes to ensuring the software we deliver, 
    goes through a rigorous set of <a href="{{ "/quality-software" | relative_url }}">quality</a> assurance processes.</p>

    <p>Our preferred way of working is to provide entire development teams to carry out bespoke development on behalf of our customers remotely or on-site, either 
    taking on the delivery of entire projects or work packages within wider programs of work. We realise that many customers already have their own in-house development teams 
    and simply need to fill specific roles within those existing teams, without the overhead of taking on full-time employees. We can provide consultants with expertise 
    across all aspects of software engineering including project management, business analysis, development, testing and dev-ops.</p>
    <p>The architecture reviews that we carry out are intended to help you and your engineers validate your ideas and draw upon the experience of our talented
    consultants. It is a fantastic way of working with us for the first time and in the past has resulted in customers instructing us to take over from incumbent suppliers.</p>
    <p>If you need to up-skill members of your existing development teams in a particular area, require them to have a deeper understanding of a particular technology or simply
    want to provide your employees with with an opportunity to enhance their skill-set, we can provide bespoke training sessions across a wide range of technologies and platforms.</p>
