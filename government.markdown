    <p>Now more than ever, the public sector must balance the stability of service delivery with the speed to react to citizens' changing needs. Often this leads to changing
    requirements for software development projects which can in turn result in costs spiralling out of control when developed using traditional methodologies. This is one of the
    reasons we carry out bespoke software development using agile methodologies; whilst this can often be a new way of working for some customers, in our experience it is the most 
    cost-effective way of working and is most likely to result in positive outcomes, compared to alternative ways of delivering bespoke software.</p>
    <p>Whether it is a digital transformation project that has the potential to positively impact every single UK citizen, programs of work to help deliver efficient, cost-effective
    public services or even unprecedented challenges of our time such as climate change, our consultants will deliver high quality software to help local and national goverment 
    meet these challenges on behalf of the public. We can provide expert consultants to fill specific roles within existing software development teams or provide entire teams 
    to carry out development on behalf of government departments remotely or on site.</p>

      <p>In an increasingly volitile world we understand the importance of designing solutions with an emphasis on security. Our consultants have considerable experience of working on secure

      <p>We take a cloud first approach to all the projects we are involved in and as such, our consultants have a wealth of experience of working with both public and private cloud. Cloud 
      based solutions when designed properly not only result in significant cost savings when compared to on-premise solutions, but are also key to government departments achieving 
      sustainability objectives.</p>
