Simon makes extensive use of <em>open source</em> projects such as <em>Spring</em> in his day to day work. In an effort to give back to the open source community,
he has released a number of open source projects, the source for which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spt-development). The artifacts are also available
in [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.spt-development) for easy inclusion in your own <em>Java</em> projects. These projects are mainly aimed
at adding logging and auditing and testing <em>Spring Boot</em> <em>microservices</em>.
