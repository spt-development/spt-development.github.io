  We recognise that it would simply be immoral to conduct our business without considering the environmental impact of our activities. Not 
  only are we passionate about delivering quality software to our customers, we are passionate about doing so in a way that prioritises our
  social and corporate responsibilities with respect to sustainability.

<h2 class="fs-4">Energy &amp; Water Usage</h2>
* We encourage our consultants to minimise their travel and commuting; through the use of digital collaboration tools we enable them to do so.
* With the exception of laptop and desktop devices, our entire IT infrastructure is cloud-hosted which has a lower environmental impact than the equivalent self-hosted solutions.
* We regularly review the sustainability position of our cloud service providers to ensure they are in line with our corporate responsibilities.
* SPT Development does not consume water directly as part of its normal business activities.

<h2 class="fs-4">Accomodation</h2>
* SPT Development's default working practice is for our consultants to work from home or from our customers' offices, therefore we do not have permanent accomodation.
* If there is a need to host meetings etc, we will rent office space on an ad-hoc basis and ensure that the sustainability position of the provider is in line with our corporate responsibilities.

<h2 class="fs-4">Business Travel</h2>
* We aim to use digital collaboration tools whenever possible to conduct meetings, helping to minimise travel for ourselves, our customers and our suppliers.
* We will always strive to minimse travel and air travel in particular.
* Our consultants use public transport for business travel, whenever practical.

<h2 class="fs-4">Commuting</h2>
* Our consultants are encouraged to work from home as much as possible.

<h2 class="fs-4">Vehicles</h2>
* All of the vehicles that we lease are fully electric.

<h2 class="fs-4">Waste Disposal</h2>
* All of the waste that is generated and can be recycled is recycled.

<h2 class="fs-4">Shipping</h2>
* We realise that carbon offsetting is no substitute for avoiding putting carbon into the atmosphere in the first place, we therefore strive to minimise our use of shipping services. However, where we absolutely must use a shipping service, such as to ship a device to one of our consultants, we record the weight of the package and the distance travelled. On an annual basis, we calculate the total “carbon cost” using an online tool such as the [Co2nsensus](https://www.co2nsensus.com/carbon-offset-calculator){:target="_blank"} calculator and make a corresponding payment to a [Gold Standard](https://marketplace.goldstandard.org/collections/projects){:target="_blank"} carbon offset project.

<h2 class="fs-4">Supply Chain Miles</h2>
* As software consultants building and delivering bespoke software solutions, we do not have the “supply chain miles” that companies that supply physical products have.

<h2 class="fs-4">Hosting</h2>
* When there is a need for us to host IT infrastructure on behalf of our customers, we choose the cloud first and ensure infrastructure is only powered on when it needs to be, in order for work to be carried out.
* We ensure that any data centres we use have a reported [power useage effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness){:target="_blank"} of 1.25 or better.

<h2 class="fs-4">Printing</h2>
* We encourage our consultants to only print documents when absolutely necessary.
* All printer cartridges are returned to the supplier for recycling.
