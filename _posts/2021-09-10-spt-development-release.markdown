I'm pleased to announced that I have now released new and up to date versions of all of the spt-development-* projects related to correlation IDs, logging and 
auditing. The main change to all of the projects is to support JDK8+ and Spring Boot 2.5.4. I will endeavor to release new versions of the libraries, soon after 
each new release of Spring Boot, moving forward. As always, the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spt-development) where there are more detailed
release notes and the artifacts are also available in [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.spt-development) for easy inclusion in your own 
<em>Java</em> projects.

The following projects have all been updated to v2.0.0:

* [spt-development-cid](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid)
* [spt-development-cid-jms-spring](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-jms-spring)
* [spt-development-cid-jms-spring-boot](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-jms-spring-boot)
* [spt-development-cid-web](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-web)
* [spt-development-cid-web-spring-boot](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-web-spring-boot)
* [spt-development-logging-spring](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-logging-spring)
* [spt-development-logging-spring-boot](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-logging-spring-boot)
* [spt-development-audit-spring](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-audit-spring)
* [spt-development-audit-spring-boot](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-audit-spring-boot)
* [spt-development-test](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-test)

I have also created a new [demo project](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-demo) that demonstrates how to easily integrate all of the 
spt-development-* projects into a Spring Boot application and the features they provide. I hope to blog in more detail on this in the coming weeks and months.

I hope this helps the community, and if there are any questions or comments, don't hesitate to get in touch.
