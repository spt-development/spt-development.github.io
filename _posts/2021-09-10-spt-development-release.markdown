I'm pleased to announced that I have now released new and up to date versions of all of the spt-development-* projects releated to correlation IDs, logging and 
auditing. The main change to all of the projects is to support JDK8+ and Spring Boot 2.5.4. I will endeavor to release new versions of the libraries, soon after 
each new release of Spring Boot, moving forward. As always, the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spt-development) where there are more detailed
release notes and the artifacts are also available in [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.spt-development) for easy inclusion in your own 
<em>Java</em> projects.

I have also created a new [demo project](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-demo) that demonstrates how to easily integrate all of the 
spt-development-* projects into a Spring Boot application and the features they provide. I hope to blog in more detail on this in the coming weeks and months.

I hope this helps the community, and if there are ny questions or comments, don't hesitate to get in touch.
