I'm pleased to announced that we have now released new versions of the spt-development-* projects related to correlation IDs, logging and auditing, 
which aligns them with the recently released [Spring Boot 2.6.6](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-boot-2-6-6-available-now). As always, 
the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spt-development) and the artifacts are also available in 
[Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.spt-development) for easy inclusion in your own <em>Java</em> projects.

The following projects have all been updated to v2.0.3 with the exception of [spt-development-cid-web](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-web)
which as been updated to v2.0.2:

* [spt-development-cid-jms-spring](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-jms-spring)
* [spt-development-cid-jms-spring-boot](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-jms-spring-boot)
* [spt-development-cid-web-spring-boot](https://github.com/spt-development/spt-development-cid-web-spring-boot)
